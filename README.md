# ðŸŽ® ClimbMaster VR â€“ Reach New Heights! ðŸš€

**IMR-Climbing-Game** is a VR climbing game developed using **Unity** and **XR Toolkit**. The project focuses on **realistic climbing mechanics**, **hand interactions**, and **physics-based movement**. Players can grab, climb, and jump while interacting with the environment using VR controllers. The game includes **custom hand modeling**, **grabbing animations**, and **immersive sound effects** for a more engaging experience.  

Below, you can find our weekly progress updates, including development logs, implemented features, and media files. ðŸŽ®ðŸ”§
